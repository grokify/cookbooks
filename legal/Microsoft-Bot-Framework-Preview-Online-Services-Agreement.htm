<h2><strong>MICROSOFT BOT FRAMEWORK– PREVIEW ONLINE SERVICES AGREEMENT</strong> </h2>
<p>Dated: July 7, 2016</p>
<p><strong>Section 1 - Description</strong> </p>
<p>This Agreement applies to Microsoft Bot Framework (the “Service”). The service components include the Service, all related documentation, media, sample code, SDKs, and other materials that Microsoft may make available from time to time for use with the Service, any updates to the foregoing, and any support for the foregoing (“Service Components”).</p>
<p>Your software application, that adds primary and significant functionality to the Service and that is not primarily a substitute for one or more Service Components ("Application" or “Bot”) may, subject to the terms of this Agreement and subject to Microsoft granting you access to the applicable Service Components, interact with the Service.</p>
<p>The Service Components may provide ways for your Application to interact with other services, such as social media services, email servers, and other communications services which may be provided by third parties or by Microsoft (“third-party services”). Third-party services are not Service Components. You acknowledge and agree that Microsoft provides any access to third-party services “as is” and “as available” without any warranties, representations or conditions of any kind and without any endorsement.</p>
<p>This Agreement does not grant you any right to access or maintain access to third-party services. You are solely responsible for your access to third-party services, and you shall comply with the terms of use for such third-party services, including but not limited to: (i) applicable privacy and data protection requirements; (ii) any rules and regulations designed for compliance with applicable laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. §§ 227, et seq. (TCPA); and (iii) any applicable codes of conduct when using the <em>Service Components</em>.</p>
<p><strong>This Agreement includes important obligations related to privacy, End Users, and Data in sections 4-8. Please read them carefully.</strong> In this Agreement: “Data” means all data, including all text, audio, images (including video), and software, that are provided to Microsoft by you or your Application (including on behalf of End Users), through the Service Components; and "End User" means you, any person you permit to access data hosted in the Service Components or otherwise use the Service Components, and any user of your Application.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2 – Acceptance of Terms</strong> </p>
<p>This Agreement is a contract between you and the Microsoft company listed in section 25 (“Microsoft”). By accessing and using the Service Components, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.</p>
<p>Microsoft may update this Agreement by posting new terms and conditions at <a href="http://aka.ms/bf-terms" class="uri">http://aka.ms/bf-terms</a>, (or a successor site). The new terms and conditions will automatically take effect and apply to your use of the Service Components after 30 days from posting. If you do not accept the new terms and conditions, you must stop using the Service Components within the 30-day period from the posting of the new terms and conditions.</p>
<p>By creating an account or accepting this Agreement, you represent that you are at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority where you live, if that is more than 18 years of age. If you are under 18 or have not reached such age of majority, your parent or legal guardian must set up an account on your behalf and accept this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Service Components are intended to function as described in the associated documentation, but please note that the Service Components are a preview and that Microsoft does not provide warranties or a service level agreement for the Service Components. <strong>This Agreement limits our liability in sections 12 and 16. Please read them carefully.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Section 5 – Your Duty to Obtain Consent</strong> </p>
<p>You will obtain consent from all End Users (and any person whose Data you transmit to the Service) to your use of the Service Components and Microsoft’s use of the Data in accordance with this Agreement. You will need to have a privacy policy if your Application collects or processes personal data from End Users and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and policy requirements. You will give End Users prominent notice of your privacy policy through your Application. Such privacy policy, at a minimum, must include a full, accurate, and clear disclosure regarding the collection and use of Data through your Application, including disclosure to End Users of any Service Components you are using, disclosure that the Data will be sent to you and Microsoft nationally or in another country or region; and describe the controls that End Users have over the use and sharing of the Data and how they may access their information. You will promptly notify Microsoft and End Users (and where legally required, obtain consent to) any material changes to your Application, the Data that it collects or processes or your privacy policy or terms of service. An Application that processes images (including video) must include a prominent notice that the End User must obtain consent from any person whose image will be processed by your Application. An Application that processes audio must include a prominent notice that the End User must obtain consent from any person whose voice will be processed by your Application.</p>
<p>You will comply with your privacy policy and all applicable legal requirements regarding privacy, the collection, use and transfer of biometric data, the use of data for discriminatory purposes, the collection of information from children, and laws regarding the collection or retention of communications, including any applicable laws and regulations requiring consent for collection of voice input, likenesses, and biometric information. You control access by End Users, and you are responsible for their use of the Service Components in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>If your Application is directed to children under the age of 13, or you knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, you will comply with all applicable laws regarding children's privacy, including but not limited to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
<p>When End User Data is sent to Microsoft, Microsoft may receive unique IDs to distinguish requests and responses. These IDs do not provide any information that allows Microsoft to personally identify End Users.</p>
<p>You will take all appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect End User Data from unauthorized use or access.</p>
<p>You will not use personal communications for the purposes of selling or targeting advertising or expose End User Data to other users or to third parties without prior explicit consent of that user.</p>
<p>If your Application includes human interaction (e.g. customer service or support) with End Users, you must provide notice to your Application’s End Users prior to their first interaction with your Application.</p>
<p>Microsoft Bot Framework does not currently support payments within Applications. Your Application may not transmit financial instrument details through the End User/Application interface. However, your Application may transmit links to secure payment services but you must disclose this in your Application’s terms of use and privacy policy (and any profile page or website for the Application) before the End User agrees to use your Application.</p>

Within a reasonable period of time from receipt of your notification,&nbsp; Microsoft will delete your Application from the directories and cease marketing your Application.</p>
<p>If your Application is published on the Microsoft or Skype Bot Directory (as applicable) you grant Microsoft, its agents, contractors, licensees, and affiliates the right to (i) use, reproduce, display, publicly perform and publish your Application information, Application or portion(s) of your Application on such directory; (ii) modify your Application description solely to correct obvious spelling, grammatical or typographical errors, in connection with, (iii) advertise or promote your Application by using its name, logo(s) and the developer’s name or company name) in any and all media, including in any marketing, presentations, demonstrations, trade shows, industry events, and press releases, in connect with the Application, or the Microsoft Bot Framework. Nothing in this Agreement will preclude Microsoft from using your Application as permitted by law without a license.</p>
